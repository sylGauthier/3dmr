## About

`3dmr` is a minimal, modular and efficient 3D renderer, written entirely in ANSI
C. It supports many features commonly found in game engines such as hierarchical
scene layout, keyframed animations with various interpolation methods, partial
`gltf` and `opengex` support.

It is written with an emphasis on clarity, simplicity, and versatility. No
structures are hidden from the user, who is free to tweak the behaviour down to
the openGL call.
